# Geo-Tracker-Map-Resolver
[Still in infancy can be used to build upon]

Dummy project that points locations tracked by Geo Tracker on a Map UI. To see this in action:

1. Build and install the Geo TrackerÂ© app
@https://github.com/gautamgitspace/Geo-Tracker
2. Track locations and export data as required.
3. Use the CSV file as a feed to this project (renaming and extension modifications might be required)
4. Run geoload.py
5. Run geodump.py
6. Open where.html
